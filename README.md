# Roulette Strategies: Castle Method and Opposite Color Method

This repository explains two roulette strategies: the **Castle Method** and the **Opposite Color Method**. These strategies are designed to manage bets in a systematic way, aiming to optimize gains and minimize losses.

## Castle Method

The Castle Method involves placing bets on specific sectors of the roulette table. Here's how it works:

- **Bet 0.50 EUR** on **0**.
- **Bet 5 EUR** on the **"2nd 12"** sector.
- **Bet 5 EUR** on the **"3rd 12"** sector.
- **Bet 0.50 EUR** on the **"1st 12"** sector, straddling the two pairs at the bottom **"1 and 4"** and **"7 and 10"** (0.50 EUR and 0.50 EUR respectively).

In total, **11.50 EUR** is staked per round using this method.

## Opposite Color Method

The **Opposite Color Method** is activated in the event of a loss with the **Castle Method** or **Opposite Color Method**, specifically when the gain from the Castle Method or Opposite Color Method decreases the total gain despite a victory.

Here's how it works:

- **Bet 8.50 EUR** on the color **opposite** to that of the number that was drawn just before. 
  - For example, if a red number belonging to the **"1st 12"** sector was drawn, you would now bet on the opposite color, i.e., **black**.

After applying the Opposite Color Method (regardless of whether it results in a victory or defeat), the **Castle Method** is applied again, and the cycle continues.
